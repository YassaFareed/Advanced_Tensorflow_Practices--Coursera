Why use transfer learning?
Instead of randomly initialized weights we can use the feature of pretrained model weights(upstream task). -> reusable patterns
Like cats and dogs have ears in pretrained modelvand weights are adjusted according to that. 
We can use this  as opposed to randomly initialized 
weigths to train cow and horse as they have similar features .

The task for which the model is borrowed is called downstream task. 


In object deteciton using mnist notebook we took all the mnist images and draw bounding box and place them at random positions in the 75x75 canvas 
with the label of the box and the label
